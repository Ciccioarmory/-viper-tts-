FiveM Sign Lang Voice

This script is intended for those who like to play on FiveM server but are not able to talk for any reason.

This is a standalone script and depend on [xsound](https://github.com/Xogy/xsound).
You can download the xsound repository but you will need to uncomment the **TextToSpeech**. Or you can use the one here.

On the **config.lua** file you can change the command to open the UI, the language, maximum distance the players will listen the voice and the volume.
